   summary: retrieve a process description
   description:  |
      The process description contains information about inputs and outputs and a link to the execution-endpoint for the process. The Core does not mandate the use of a specific process description to specify the interface of a process. That said, the Core requirements class makes the following recommendation:

      Implementations SHOULD consider supporting the OGC process description.

      For more information, see [Section 7.8](https://docs.ogc.org/is/18-062r2/18-062r2.html#sc_process_description).
