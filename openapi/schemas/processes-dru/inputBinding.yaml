  . Defines how to specify the input for the execution unit.
  . The value of various properties defined below can be expressions.
      . The expression language SHALL be JavaScript(???).
  . The "$(...)" syntax can be used to reference the current input or other
    process inputs in an expression.
    . The value "self" refers to the value of the current input.
    . The value "inputs.<other_input>" refers to the value of another
      process input.
    . If the input is defined as a string of format "file" or "directory"
      then the meta-values ".path", ".basename", ".nameroot" and ".nameext"
      can be used to manipulate file or directory name without having to
      resort to complex regular expressions.
        . ".path" returns the path of a file name without the file name
        . ".basename" returns the name of the file without the path
        . ".nameroot" returns the basename without any extension
        . ".nameext" returns the extension of the basename

      . If valueFrom is a constant string value, use this as the value.
      . If valueFrom is an expression, evaluate the expression to yield the
        actual value to use to build the command line.
      . If the value of the associated input parameter is null, valueFrom is
        not evaluated and nothing is added to the command line.
