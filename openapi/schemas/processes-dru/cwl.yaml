      The schema validation of the CWL will not itself perform the '$import' to resolve and validate its contents.
      Therefore, the complete schema will not be validated entirely, and could still be partially malformed.
      To ensure proper and exhaustive validation of a CWL definition with this schema, all '$import' directives
      should be resolved and extended beforehand.

      Minimum reserved number of CPU cores.
      
      May be a fractional value to indicate to a scheduling algorithm that one core can be allocated to
      multiple jobs. For example, a value of 0.25 indicates that up to 4 jobs
      may run in parallel on 1 core. A value of 1.25 means that up to 3 jobs
      can run on a 4 core system (4/1.25 ~ 3).
      
      Processes can only share a core allocation if the sum of each of their 'ramMax', 'tmpdirMax', and
      'outdirMax' requests also do not exceed the capacity of the node.
      
      Processes sharing a core must have the same level of isolation (typically a container
      or VM) that they would normally have.
      
      The reported number of CPU cores reserved for the process, which is available to expressions 
      on the 'CommandLineTool' as 'runtime.cores', must be a non-zero integer, and may be calculated by
      rounding up the cores request to the next whole number.
      
      Scheduling systems may allocate fractional CPU resources by setting quotas or scheduling weights.
      Scheduling systems that do not support fractional CPUs may round up the request to the next whole number.

      If a parameter is listed more than once, it becomes a nested array. As a result,
      upstream parameters which are connected to scattered parameters must be arrays.

      All output parameter types are also implicitly wrapped in arrays. Each job

      Validate that the 'default' value, if specified, is of same type as the CWL 'type'.
      This avoids over-accepting anything that does not match the intended type.
      However, validation limits itself to data literals and arrays.
      Nested type and multi-type definitions will validate against 'Any'.

    description: |
      Describes how to decompose the scattered input into a discrete
      set of jobs. When 'dotproduct', specifies that each of the input arrays
      are aligned and one element taken from each array to construct each job.
      It is an error if all input arrays are of different length. When 'nested_crossproduct',
      specifies the Cartesian product of the inputs, producing a job for every
      combination of the scattered inputs. The output must be nested arrays
      for each level of scattering, in the order that the input arrays are listed
      in the scatter field. When 'flat_crossproduct', specifies the Cartesian
      product of the inputs, producing a job for every combination of the scattered
      inputs. The output arrays must be flattened to a single level, but otherwise
      listed in the order that the input arrays are listed in the scatter field.
