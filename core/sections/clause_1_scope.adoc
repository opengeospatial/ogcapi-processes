The OGC API - Processes Standard (aka "Processes API") specifies requirements of a Web API that enables the execution of computing processes and the retrieval of metadata describing their purpose and functionality. Typically, these processes combine raster, vector, coverage and/or point cloud data with well-defined algorithms to produce new raster, vector, coverage and/or point cloud information.
