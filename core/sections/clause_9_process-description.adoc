== Requirements Class "OGC Process Description"

The following section describes the `OGC Process Description` requirements
class.


=== Overview

include::../requirements/requirements_class_ogc-process-description.adoc[]

The OGC process description is an information model that may be used to specify the interface of a process.  This model is an evolution of the process description model originally defined in the http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-065/14-065.html[OGC WPS 2.0.2 Interface Standard] but also includes elements of the http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3[OpenAPI Specification].  Specifically, this process description languages uses https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core.html[JSON Schema] fragments to define the input and output parameters of a process.  As such, this process description provides a bridge from legacy implementations to using the OGC API Framework.

NOTE: The use of other schema languages for describing the interface to a process is permitted but is outside the scope of this Standards.  A description of how other schema languages would be used to describe the interface of a process would need to be described in a new conformance class added to this Standard or in a new Part of the OGC API - Processes suite of standards.

The process description allows the following information to be specified:

* An identifier for the process
* Descriptive metadata about the process:
** A title
** A narrative description of the process
** Keywords that can be associated with the process
** References to additional metadata
* A description of each process input specified using a https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core.html[JSON Schema] fragment.
* A description of each process output specified using a https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core.html[JSON Schema] fragment.
* A job control specification that indicates whether the process can be invoked synchronously, asynchronously, or either.
* An output transmission specification that indicates how the results of a process are retrieved; either by value or by reference
* A section for additional parameters that are intended for communities of use to extend the process description as required.

The following clause defines a JSON-encoding of the OGC process description.

=== Describing a process input

==== Overview

include::../requirements/ogc-process-description/REQ_inputs-def.adoc[]

Each process input is characterized by its schema, its cardinality and whether the input value can be passed by-value, by-reference or both.

include::../recommendations/ogc-process-description/REC_format-key.adoc[]

Processes that perform geo-spatial processing can be expected to have geometric and feature input types.  In JSON, geometries, features and collections of feature are commonly encoded using https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946[GeoJSON].  Rather the requiring processes descriptions to embed or reference the full schemas for https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946[GeoJSON] geometries, features or feature collections, this Standard defines a common set of convenience tokens that can be used instead.  

The <<jsonschemavalidation,JSON Schema specification>> defines a https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation.html#rfc.section.7[set of values] for the `format` key.  This Standard extends this list by defining the following additional key values for use specifically in OGC process descriptions.

==== Data classes

One common input type that a process might accept is a https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-069r4/17-069r4.html#_collection_[feature collection] indicating that the process will operate over the items of the collection.  This implies that the process will have certain expections about the structure of the collection with regard to which properties the collection contains, their types, etc.  In order to properly handle any arbitrary input collection a process would need to inspect the structure of the collection to ensure that all the expected properties with the expected schemas and semantics are present.  To alleviate the server from having to perform such a tedious, and perhaps computationally expensive, validation step this Standard introduces the concept of the _Data Class_ via the `dataClasses` parameter.  
The value of the `dataClasses` parameter is an array of URIs.  Each URI identifies the schema, and optionally semantics, of a predefined set of properties. Two data resources tagged with the same data class URI value can be assumed to each contain all the properties defined by the data class.  This equivalence allows a server to quickly validate that an input data resource meets the server's expections in terms of the properties available for processing simply by comparing data class URI values.  If the data class URI of the input data resource matches at least one of the data class URIs specified in the description of the process input (via the `dataClasses` parameter) then the server can assume that the process can operate on that data resource.

NOTE: Care should be taken when tagging data resources with a data class URI.  Both the schema and the semantics of each property in the data class must match the correspoding properties of the data resource.  Consider two data resources that both contain fields `a` and `b` with the same data types but differ in, for example, units of measure.  In this case, these two data resources should not be tagged with the same data class URI. While the schemas of `a` and `b` in the two data resources are the same, the semantics are clearly different.

The `dataClasses` parameter is an array allowing process inputs to be described that can handle a variety of data classes.  As long as the data class URI associated with an input data resource matches at least one of the data class URIs listed in the `dataClasses` array the server can assume that the process can operate on that input data process.

The `dataClasses` parameter can also be used when describing process outputs and indicates that the generated output conforms to the schema requirements of the data class.  This allows, for example, for a simple determination of whether the output of one process is suitable as an input to another process.

This clause started by introducing the concept of the _Data Class_ in relation to a https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-069r4/17-069r4.html#_collection_[feature collection] but the concept is a general one applying to any number of data resources such as feature collections, coverages, styles, etc.  For example, a specific data class might be defined to include a geometry property _fenceLine_ of type _polygon_.  Thus, any input feature collection tagged with this data class's URI can be expected to include a _fenceLine_ property and its type can be assumed to be _polygon_.  Similarly, a data class could be defined that identifies a set of bands in a coverage, say R, G, B and NIR.  Any coverages tagged with this data class's URI can thus be assumed to contain these bands.  The _Data Class_ concept is also independent of the particular encoding used for the data resource.  So, applying data class validation applies equally to feature collections encoded as GeoJSON documents as it does to feature collections encodes as SHAPE files.  Finally, the _Data Class_ concept is independent of whether data resource values are passed to a process by-value or by-reference.  In either case the server goes through the same procedure (i.e. comparing data class URIs) to determine whether a specific input value is suitable for processing as per the process description.

[NOTE]
====
. A data resource tagged with a specific data class will contain all the properties defined for that class but may also contain additional properties that are not members of the class.  A process expecting an input value of a particular data class value would simply ignore these extraneous properties.

. A data resource can be tagged with more than one data class URI indicating that it satisfies all the requirements of all the data classes associated with the resource.

. In order for the _Data Class_ concept to be most effective a registry akin to that found at https://schema.org[Schema.org] would need to be created and maintained.  The OGC definition server is likely the best place to define and manage _Data Class_ URIs.

==== Cardinality

===== Overview

The cardinality on an input is specified using the `minOccurs` and `maxOccurs` parameters from the input's definition in the <<sc_process_description,process description>>.  The default values of `minOccurs` and `maxOccurs` are 1 indicating that a single input of the corresponding name must be specified in an execute request.  The following table covers the various combinations of `minOccurs` and `maxOccurs` values.

[[cardinality_rules]]
.Cardinality rules for process inputs.
[cols=",,,",options="header"]
|===
|minOccurs |maxOccurs |Interpretation |Example
|0 |0 |Not Allowed |
|0 |1 |A single input value *may* be optionally specified. | "input": {value}
|1 |1 |A single input value *must* be specified. | "input": {value}
|1 |N |At least 1 input value *must* be specified.  +
Regardless of the number of input values provided, those values *must* be encoded using an array. | "input": [{value}] OR +
"input": [{value1},...,{valueN}]
|M |N |All values provided *must* be encoded using an array. |"input": [{value1},...,{valueM}] OR +
"input": [{value1},...,{valueM},...,{valueN}]
|===

NOTE: The tokens `{value}`, `{value1}`, `{valueN}` or `{valueM}` represent values of the type expected for the input according to its definition.  This can include array values.

===== Interaction of `minOccurs`/`maxOccurs` and `minItems`/`maxItems`

The `schema` member of the <<process-input-schema,input definition>> in the <<sc_process_description,process description>> defines the schema of a single instance of an input.  If the input happens to be an array then the `minItems` and `maxItems` properties may be used to define the limits of the array.  The use of `minItems` and `maxItems` in the definition of the input does not affect how `minOccurs` and `maxOccurs` are interpreted and the same <<cardinality_rules,cardinality rules>> apply.

Consider the following definitions of an input named "input".

[[schema_examples]]
.Schema examples for cardinality
[cols="50a,50a",options="header"]
|===
|Example Schema| Examples instances
|
[[row1-example]]
[source,yaml]
----
inputs:
  input:
    schema:
      type: array
      maxItems: 2
      items:
        type: string
----

In this case the schema of an input value is defined as an array and so will always be encoded as an array in an execute request.
|
[source,JSON]
----
"input": ["value1"]
----
*or*
[source,JSON]
----
"input": ["value1","value2"]
----
|
[source,yaml]
----
inputs:
  input:
    maxOccurs: 2
    schema:
      type: string
----

In this case, the schema of the input is defined as a plain string with a cardinality of 2.  Inputs with cardinalities of greater than 1 are encoded as arrays in an execute request.  This situation is equivalently encoded to the <<row1-example,previous row>>. +
Servers, however, being internally aware of the definition of each input, can disambiguate the input values accordingly (treating the values in this example as string values and the values in the <<row1-example,above example>> as arrays of values).
|
[source,JSON]
----
"input": ["value1"]
----
*or*
[source,JSON]
----
"input": ["value1","value2"]
----
|
[source,yaml]
----
inputs:
  input:
    maxOccurs: 2
    schema:
      type: array
      maxItems: 2
      items:
        type: string
----

In this case we have an input with cardinality greater than 1 but that has values that themselves are defined as arrays.  Since inputs with cardinality greater than 1 are encoded as arrays in an execute request, the result is that the inputs are encoded as arrays of arrays.
