== Requirements Class "Core"

The following section describes the core requirements class.


=== Overview

include::../requirements/requirements_class_core.adoc[]

A server that implements the OGC API - Processes provides access to processes.

Each OGC API - Processes has a single `LandingPage` (path `/`) that provides links to

* The `APIDefinition` (no fixed path),
* The `Conformance` statements (path `/conformance`),
* The `processes` metadata (path `/processes`).

Note that additional requirements classes may introduce additional links for the landing page.

The `APIDefinition` describes the capabilities of the server that can be used by
clients to connect to the server or by development tools to support the
implementation of servers and clients. Accessing the `APIDefinition` using
HTTP GET returns a description of the API.

Accessing `Conformance` using HTTP GET returns a list of URIs of
requirements classes implemented by the server.

The list of processes contains a summary of each process the OGC API - Processes offers, including the link to a more detailed description of the process.

The <<sc_process_description,process description>> contains information about inputs and outputs and a link to the execution-endpoint for the process.

A HTTP POST request to the execution-endpoint creates a new job. The inputs and outputs need to be passed in a JSON execute-request.

The URL for accessing status information is delivered in the HTTP header `location`.

After a process is finished (status = success/failed), the results/exceptions can be retrieved.

[[sc_landing_page]]
=== Retrieve the API landing page

The following section defines the requirements to retrieve an API landing page.


==== Operation

include::../requirements/core/REQ_landingpage-op.adoc[]


==== Response

include::../requirements/core/REQ_landingpage-success.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
The term "_...based upon the OpenAPI 3.0 schema..._" used in the requirements of this specification means that OpenAPI 3.0 is used to define:

* all the required properties of the respective request/response schema,
* and any optional properties of the respective request/response schema.

It also mean that unless explicitly excluded these schemas are extensible with additional properties not defined in the schema using the https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.0.md#schemaObject[`additionalProperties`] mechanism defined in the https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.0.md[OpenAPI 3.0 specification].

[[sc_api_definition]]
=== Retrieve an API definition

The following section defines the requirements to retrieve an API definition.


==== Operation

Every OGC API - Processes provides an API definition that describes the capabilities
of the server. This definition is used by developers to understand the API,
by software clients to connect to the server, or
by development tools to support the implementation of servers and clients.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_api-definition-op.adoc[]

include::../recommendations/core/PER_api-definition-uri.adoc[]

Note that multiple API definition formats can be supported.


==== Response

include::../requirements/core/REQ_api-definition-success.adoc[]

include::../recommendations/core/REC_api-definition-oas.adoc[]

If multiple API definition formats are supported by a server, use
content negotiation to select the desired representation.

[NOTE]
====
Two common approaches are:

* an additional path for each encoding of each resource (this can be expressed,
for example, using format specific suffixes like ".html");

* an additional query parameter (for example, "accept" or "f") that overrides
the Accept header of the HTTP request.
====

The API definition document describes the API. In other words,
there is no need to include the `/api` operation in the API definition itself.

The idea is that any OGC API - Processes can be used by developers that are familiar with
the API definition language(s) supported by the server. For example, if
an OpenAPI definition is used, it should be possible to create a working
client using the OpenAPI definition. The developer may need to learn a little
bit about geospatial data types, etc., but it should not be required to read
this standard to access the processes and results via the API.


==== Error situations

See <<http_status_codes>> for general guidance.

[[sc_conformance_classes]]
=== Declaration of conformance classes

==== Operation

To support "generic" clients for accessing servers implementing OGC API - Processes in general - and
not "just" a specific API / server, the server has to declare the
requirements classes it implements and conforms to.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_conformance-op.adoc[]

=== Use of HTTP 1.1

include::../requirements/core/REQ_http.adoc[]

[[http_status_codes]]
==== HTTP status codes

<<status_codes>> lists the main HTTP status codes that clients should be
prepared to receive.

This includes, for example, support for specific security schemes or URI
redirection.

In addition, other error situations may occur in the transport layer
outside of the server.

[[status_codes]]
.Typical HTTP status codes
[cols="15,85",options="header"]
|===
|Status code |Description
|`200` |A successful request.
|`201` |The request was successful and one or more new resources have being created.
|`204` |The request was successful but did not generate any content.
|`400` |The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error. For example, a query parameter had an incorrect value.
|`401` |The request requires user authentication. The response includes a `WWW-Authenticate` header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource.
|`403` |The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. While status code `401` indicates missing or bad authentication, status code `403` indicates that authentication is not the issue, but the client is not authorized to perform the requested operation on the resource.
|`404` |The requested resource does not exist on the server. For example, a path parameter had an incorrect value.
|`405` |The request method is not supported. For example, a POST request was submitted, but the resource only supports GET requests.
|`406` |The `Accept` header submitted in the request did not support any of the media types supported by the server for the requested resource.
|`410` |The target resource is no longer available at the origin server.
|`429` |The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting").
|`500` |An internal error occurred in the server.
|`501` |The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
|===

More specific guidance is provided for each resource, where applicable.

include::../recommendations/core/PER_additional-status-codes.adoc[]

When a server encounters an error in the processing of a request, it may wish to include information in addition to the status code in the response. Since Web API interactions are often machine-to-machine, a machine-readable report would be preferred. [RFC 7807](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807) addresses this need by providing "Problem Details" response schemas for both JSON and XML.

include::../recommendations/core/REC_problem-details.adoc[]


=== Support for cross-origin requests

Access to content from a HTML page is by default prohibited for security reasons if the content is located on another host than the webpage ("same-origin policy"). Cross-origin resource sharing is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served. A typical example is a web-application accessing processes and data from multiple servers.

include::../recommendations/core/REC_cross-origin.adoc[]

Two common mechanisms to support cross-origin requests are:

* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing[Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)]
* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP[JSONP (JSON with padding)]

include::../recommendations/core/REC_access-control-expose-headers.adoc[]

include::../recommendations/core/REC_html.adoc[]


[[sc_limit_parameter]]
=== Limit parameter

Several resources defined in this specification (see <<sc_process_list,Retrieve a process list>>, <<sc_job_list,Retrieve a job list>>) use the `limit` parameter to control the number of results that are presented in a response.

* The client can request a limit it is interested in.

* The server likely has a default value for the limit, and a maximum limit.

* If the server has any more results available than it returns (the number it returns is less than or equal to the requested/default/maximum limit) then the server will include a link to the next set of results.

So (using the default/maximum values of 10/1000 from the OpenAPI fragment in requirement <<req_core_pl-limit-definition,`/req/core/pl-limit-definition`>> or <<req_job-list_limit-definition,`/req/job-list/limit-definition`>>):

* If you ask for 10 results, you will get 0 to 10 (as requested) and if there are more, a `next` link;

* If you don't specify a limit, you will get 0 to 10 (default) and if there are more, a `next` link;

* If you ask for 5000 results, you might get up to 1000 (server-limited) and if there are more, a `next` link;

* If you follow the next link from the previous response, you might get up to 1000 additional results and if there are more, a `next` link.

This document make requirements and recommendations about links in general and the `next` link in particular at the appropriate resource end points.

[[next-link-discussion]]
This document does not mandate any specific implementation approach for the `next` links.

An implementation could use opaque links that are managed by the server. It is up to the server to determine how long these links can be dereferenced. Clients should be prepared to receive a 404 response.

Another implementation approach is to use an implementation-specific parameter that specifies the index within the result set from which the server begins presenting results in the response, like `offset` or the `startIndex` parameter that was used in <<WFS20,WFS 2.0>>.

The API will return no `next` link, if it has returned all selected results, and the server knows that. However, the server may not be aware that it has already returned all selected results. For example, if the request states `limit=10` and the query to the backend returns 10 results, the server may not know, if there are more results or not (in most cases there will be more results), unless the total number of results is also computed, which may be too costly. The server will then add the next link, and if there are no more results, dereferencing the next link will return an empty results list and no next link. This behavior is consistent with the statements above.

Clients should not assume that paging is safe against changes to dataset while a client iterates through `next` links. If a server provides opaque links these could be safe and maintain the state during the original request. Using a parameter for the start index, however, will not be safe.

[[prev-link-discussion]]
This document also makes recommendations about include a `prev` link at the appropriate resource end points.  Providing `prev` links supports navigating back and forth between pages, but depending on the implementation approach it may be too complex to implement.

[[sc_process_inputs]]
===== Process inputs

*_Overview:_*

Each process input is a name/value pair that appears in the `inputs` section of
an execute request.

The name of each input is its identifier as specified by the input's definition in the <<sc_process_description,process description>>.

Process input values in an execute request can be specified in-line or by reference.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_process-execute-inputs.adoc[]

As shown in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-processes/master/core/openapi/schemas/inlineOrRefData.yaml[inlineOrRefData.yaml], a process input value that is specified in-line in an execute request can be:

* a simple literal value,
* an array,
* a qualified value,
* a binary value,
* or a bounding box.

[[simple-literals]]
*_Simple literal values:_*

A simple literal value can be a string, number, integer or Boolean.

NOTE: In an execute request, as per requirement <<req_core_process-execute-input-inline-object,/req/core/process-execute-input-inline-object>>, object values must be encoded as <<qualified-value,qualified values>> to prevent unintended ambiguity with the built-in value types (i.e. <<bounding-box-value,bounding boxes>>, <<link-schema,links>> or <<qualified-value,qualified values>>).
====

[[qualified-value]]
*_Qualified values:_*

A qualified value is a <<input-value-schema,value>> that can be optionally qualified with a `format` parameter.

Qualified values can be used to encode process input values that, according to their definition in the <<sc_process_description,process description>>, can be of multiple media types.  The `format` parameter is used to identify the specific media type being provided as the process input.

Qualified values can also be used to encode object-valued process inputs in order to avoid ambiguity with the built-in value schemas defined in this standard (i.e. <<bounding-box-value,bbox.yaml>>, <<link-schema,link.yaml>> or <<qualified-value,qualifiedInputValue.yaml>> itself).

The actual _value_ in a qualified value object is specified using the `value` key.  The value of the `value` key is an instance of <<input-value-schema,inputValue.yaml>>.

[[binary-value]]
*_Binary values:_*

In some cases, for example in order to pass through firewalls, binary input values need to be encoded in-line in an execute request as a string.

This is an example of an image process input whose media type is defined in the
<<sc_process_description,process description>>.  The schema definition for this process input might be:

[source,json]

"schema": {
  "type": "string",
  "contentEncoding": "binary",
  "contentMediaType": "application/tiff; application=geotiff"

----

NOTE: Even though the schema indicates that the input type is `binary`, when the input value is encoded in-line in an execute request, as per requirement <<req_core_process-execute-input-inline-binary,/req/core/process-execute-input-inline-binary>>, the binary value is encoded as base64-encoded string.

In this second example, the image input can be one of a number of value types denoted in JSON Schema by the use of the `oneOf[]` construct.  An example schema for this a process input might be:

[source,json]

NOTE: This schema can also be obtained from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-processes/master/core/openapi/schemas/bbox.yaml[`bbox.yaml`].

This schema is meant to be a template for defining bounding box process inputs. If the specified `default` and `enum` are suitable for your purposes then you can reference this file directly in your process description.

include::../recommendations/core/PER_process-execute-input-inline-bbox.adoc[]

*_Input validation_*

Process inputs in an execute request and the corresponding process input definition in the <<sc_process_description,process description>> have a validation relationship.  That is to say, that the schema of a process input definition from the <<sc_process_description,process description>> can be used to validate the component of the corresponding process input value in an execute request that is an instance of <<input-value-schema,inputValue.yaml>>.

[%unnumbered]
====
Consider a process input named `complexObjectInput` with the following definition from an <<ogc_process_description,OGC process description>>:

[source,json]
----
"complexObjectInput": {
  "title": "Complex Object Input Example",
  "description": "This is an example of a complex object input.",
  "schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "required": [
      "property1",
      "property5"
    ],
    "properties": {
      "property1": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "property2": {
        "type": "string",
        "format": "uri"
      },
      "property3": {
        "type": "number"
      },
      "property4": {
        "type": "string",
        "format": "dateTime"
      },
      "property5": {
        "type": "boolean"
      }
    }
  }
}
----

and the following instance in an execute request:

[source,json]
----
"inputs": [
  .
  .
  .
  "complexObjectInput": {
    "value": {
      "property1": "value1",
      "property2": "value2",
      "property3": "value5"
    }
  },
  .
  .
  .
]
----

The process input value in this execute request is an instance of a <<qualified-value,qualified value>>.

For the purposes of validation, the server need only validate the component of the <<qualified-value,qualified value>> that is an instance of <<input-value-schema,inputValue.yaml>> against the `schema` fragment from the <<ogc_process_description,OGC process description>>.  Specifically, the validation target is:

[source,json]
----
{
  "property1": "value1",
  "property2": "value2",
  "property3": "value5"
}
----

NOTE: This example makes use of an <<ogc_process_description,OGC process description>>.  However, any other process description vocabulary may be used and applied, for the purpose of validation, in a similar manner.

[[sc_execution_mode]]
===== Execution mode

A process may be executed synchronously or asynchronously.

In which of these two modes a server responds is a function of the job control options specified in the <<sc_process_description,process description>> and the presence or absence of the HTTP `Prefer` header (http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7240.txt[IETF RFC 7240]).

include::../requirements/core/REQ_process-execute-default-execution-mode.adoc[]

include::../requirements/core/REQ_process-execute-auto-execution-mode.adoc[]

include::../recommendations/core/REC_process-execute-honor-prefer.adoc[]

include::../recommendations/core/REC_process-execute-handle-prefer.adoc[]

include::../recommendations/core/REC_process-execute-preference-applied.adoc[]

===== Response type

The `response` parameter selects the form used to present processing results.

* A `response` value of `document` indicates that the server should generate a response document (see https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-processes/master/core/openapi/schemas/results.yaml[results.yaml]) that contains each of the requested process outputs.
* A `response` value of `raw` indicates that the server should present the process responses in their native form without the use of a containing document.

The default value, if the parameter is not specified is `raw`.

[[sc_process_outputs]]
===== Process outputs

*_Overview:_*

Each process output is a named object that appears in the `outputs` section of
an <<execute-request-body,execute request>>. The name of each output is its identifier as specified by the output's definition in the <<sc_process_description,process description>>.

*_Default outputs_*

include::../requirements/core/REQ_process-execute-default-outputs.adoc[]

*_Output value transmission mode_*

Like inputs, output values can be transmitted in-line in a result document or referenced using a <<link-schema,link>>.  The `transmissionMode` parameter in the execute request controls how the server <<sc_execute_response,responds>>.

[[tx-mode-schema]]
.Schema for the transmission mode
[source,yaml]
----
include::../openapi/schemas/transmissionMode.yaml[]
----

NOTE: This schema can also be obtained from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-processes/master/core/openapi/schemas/transmissionMode.yaml[`transmissionMode.yaml`].

*_Output value format_*

A process output can be defined in the <<sc_process_description,process description>> as being of one or more media types.   In cases where a specific output can be presented in one of a number of media types, the `format` parameter in the <<output-schema,execute request>> can be used to indicate the format that should be used to present the process output value in the server's <<sc_execute_response,response>>.

[[sc_execute_response]]
==== Response

The manner in which a server responds to a process execution request is determined by the following parameters:

* the <<sc_execution_mode,negotiated execution mode>> (synchronous or asynchronous),
* the `response` parameter (`document` or `raw`),
* the `transmissionMode` parameter (`value` or `reference`)
* and the number of outputs requested.

The following table maps the possible responses based on the combinations of these execute parameters.

The value _any_ in a cell means _"for any valid value of the execute parameter represented by that cell"_.

This table shows all possible combinations of execute parameters that are specified by this standard.  Not all of these combinations need to be implemented by a server conforming to this standard.  For example, if a server only offers processes that support multiple outputs **by value**, then the server **must** support `multipart/related` responses as indicated in <<table_core_execute_responses>>.  If, on the other hand, the server only offers processes that support multiple outputs **by reference**, then the server does not need to support `multipart/related` responses.

NOTE: This schema can also be obtained from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-processes/master/core/openapi/schemas/results.yaml[`results.yaml`].

This schema defines a map using the respective output identifier as the key. The value of an output can be returned as an in-line value or by reference.

For a synchronous execution, the following requirements apply:

include::../requirements/core/REQ_process-execute-success-sync-raw-value-one.adoc[]

include::../requirements/core/REQ_process-execute-success-sync-document.adoc[]

include::../recommendations/core/REC_process-execute-sync-document-ref.adoc[]

This specification does not mandate that servers create a job as a result of executing a process synchronously.  However the following permission is given:

include::../recommendations/core/PER_process-execute-sync-job.adoc[]

For servers that implement this permission and do create a job as a result of synchronous execution of a process, the following requirement applies:

include::../requirements/core/REQ_job-results-success-sync.adoc[]

The job reference in the header can then be used to <<async-fetch,re-fetch the results>> of the original synchronous execution.

In the case of asynchronous execution, the following requirement applies:

include::../requirements/core/REQ_process-execute-success-async.adoc[]


==== Error situations

See <<http_status_codes>> for general guidance.

If the process with the specified identifier does not exist on the server, see requirement <<req_core_process-exception-no-such-process,/req/core/process-exception/no-such-process>>.

The job status information includes several optional date-time fields that represent milestones in the life cycle of a job.   The following are recommended for servers that decide to populate some or all of these date-time fields:

include::../recommendations/core/REC_job-status.adoc[]

NOTE: Once a job has finished execution and is no longer consuming compute resources, the duration of processing can be computed as `finished-started`.  The `updated` field, however, may still be revised as the system continues processing outputs, storing results, releasing compute resources, etc.
