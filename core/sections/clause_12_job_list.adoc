.Schema for the job list
[source,yaml]
----
include::../../openapi/schemas/processes-core/jobList.yaml[]
----

NOTE: This schema can also be obtained from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-processes/master/openapi/schemas/processes-core/jobList.yaml[`jobList.yaml`].

(see also: <<schema-statusInfo,statusInfo.yaml>>, <<link-schema,link.yaml>>)

The schema defines an array of <<schema-statusInfo,status info elements>> and includes a links section for navigation links within the API.

The number of jobs returned depends on the server and the parameter `limit.`

See the discussion about the `limit` parameter in the <<sc_limit_parameter,Limit parameter>> section.

include::../requirements/job-list/REQ_links.adoc[]

See the discussion about the `next` links in the <<next-link-discussion,Limit parameter>> section.

include::../recommendations/job-list/REC_next-2.adoc[]

include::../recommendations/job-list/REC_next-3.adoc[]

See the discussion about the `prev` link in the  <<prev-link-discussion,Limit parameter>> section.
