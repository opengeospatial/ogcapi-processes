=== Introduction

OGC Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are not Web Services in the traditional sense. Rather, they define the behavior and content of a set of Resources exposed through a Web API. Therefore, an API may expose resources in addition to those defined by the standard. A test engine must be able to traverse the API, identify and validate test points, and ignore resource paths which are not to be tested.

The following requirement applies for a server implementing the OGC API - Processes - Part 1: Core under test:
