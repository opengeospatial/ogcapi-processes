== Overview

The OGC API - Processes Standard builds on the WPS 2.0 Standard and is modularized. This means that there is a separation between:

* Core requirements, that specify basic capabilities and can easily be mapped to existing OGC Web Processing Services.
* More advanced functionality that is not specified in WPS 2.0.


=== Encodings

JSON is the encoding for requests and responses. The inputs and outputs of a process can be in any format. The formats are defined at the time of job creation and are fixed for the specific job.

<<rc_html,Support for HTML>> is recommended as HTML is the core language of the World Wide Web.
A server that supports HTML will support browsing with a web browser
and will enable search engines to crawl and index the processes.
