== Security Considerations

The OGC API - Processes Standard makes use of different HTTP methods, namely GET, POST and DELETE. (Note that future extensions could introduce additional HTTP methods.)

HTTP methods can be classified as

* Safe, meaning that they do not alter the state of (a resource on) the server, and
* Idempotent, meaning that can be executed an indefinite number of times and deliver the same result.

<<http_methods_safety>> gives an overview of the classification of HTTP the methods used in this standard:

|HTTP Method  |Safe |Idempotent

|GET        |yes  |yes
|POST       |no   |no
|DELETE     |no   |yes
3+|Source <<rfc7231,RFC 7231, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content>>

|===

The following resources can be retrieved using the safe HTTP GET operation and can contain sensitive information:

Requirements class "Core":

* <<sc_process_list,Process list>>
* <<sc_process_description,Process description>>
* <<sc_retrieve_status_info,Job status info>>
* <<sc_retrieve_job_results,Job results>>

Requirements class "Job list"

* <<sc_job_list,list>>

The following API - Processes operations use unsafe HTTP methods, modify resources and therefore require special attention:

Requirements class "Core":

* <<sc_execute_process,Execute>>, HTTP POST

Requirements class "Dismiss"

* <<Dismiss,Dismiss>>, HTTP DELETE


=== Operations using HTTP GET

Most of the operations defined in the OGC API - Processes Standard use the safe HTTP GET operation. However, the resources that are returned by these operations contain information that could be used to exploit implementations of the Processes API. <<table_core_safe_operations_security>> gives an overview of the resources specified in this standard and what kind of information they contain.


[[table_core_safe_operations_security]]
.Requirements class 'Core' - Overview of core operations and returned sensitive information
[cols="20,30,10,40",options="header"]
|===
|Resource |Path |HTTP method | Information delivered

|Landing page |`/` |GET| General information about the service, links to API endpoints
|Conformance classes |`/conformance` |GET| List of conformance classes
|Process list |`/processes` |GET | Process identifiers, links to process descriptions
|Process description |`/processes/{processID}` |GET | Information about a process, e.g. inputs/outputs
|Job status info |`/jobs/{jobID}` |GET | Status info, links to results or exceptions
|Job results |`/jobs/{jobID}/results` |GET | Job results

|===

The following is more detailed information on the resources:

* The landing page can include links to endpoints, that are not defined in the API - Processes Standard, that can lead to all the other resources that the containing API might offer.

* The list of conformance classes could contain information about extensions like "dismiss" that pose additional security issues.

* The process list contains process identifiers and links to the respective process descriptions.

* The process description contains all necessary information needed to execute a process. This information can be used to send a JSON execute request to the Processes API that will pass initial sanity checks, for example checks for the correct input/output identifiers.  The ability to pass values to the server is vulnerable to injection attacks and issues as discussed in section <<sec_cons_execute>> can occur.

* The job status info contains not only status information, but for finished processes also links to results / exceptions. The results of a process execution are a valuable resource as well as the exceptions that could contain hints about why the execution has failed.

|Resource |Path |HTTP method | Information delivered
|Job list |`/jobs` |GET | List of job IDs and status info, links to results or exceptions
|===

The retrieval of the job list of a process returns the job IDs and links to the respective job status.


[[sec_cons_execute]]
=== Execute operation

The execute operation uses HTTP POST to create new processing jobs (process executions). As discussed above, the HTTP POST method is not safe and it poses the following threats if misused:

* The processing can require considerable server resources, for example computing time, network traffic (when accessing referenced inputs) or storage space for inputs and outputs.
* Malicious inputs can be encoded either inline in the execute request JSON or by reference by providing URIs to malicious input values in the execute request JSON.

[cols="20,30,10,40",options="header"]
|===
|Resource |Path |HTTP method | Information delivered

|Job status info |`/jobs` |POST | Job id, status info, (links to) results or exceptions

|===

The new job IDs that are returned in the status info document should be created in a non-guessable way, for example using UUIDs. This will prevent random attempts to get job status information, results / exceptions or even cancel jobs / delete job artifacts.

[[sec_cons_dismiss]]
=== Dismiss operation

The optional dismiss extension uses the HTTP DELETE method and can be used to

* Cancel a running job, and
* Remove artifacts of a finished job.

Both usages pose security related issues. The cancellation of a running job (if not done on purpose) is wasting the resources that the job used prior to being cancelled. The same issue applies to the unwanted removal of artifacts of a finished job. If the dismiss extension is implemented, access control for the operation should be considered. The dismiss operation is idempotent, as it is specified by this Standard to be called using a specific job identifier. The first dismiss request to that identifier will result in a HTTP 200 (OK) status code. Continued dismiss requests using the same identifier result in a HTTP 410 (Gone) error code, but nothing else is changed on the server. A successful dismiss request returns a status info document containing the job identifier and the status "dismissed". This status info document has no further security implications.
