====
If a server implementing the OGC API - Processes - Part 1: Core is tested using CITE tests, the server SHOULD offer one of the following options:

. An Echo process that returns any input that is provided, without any actual processing. 
. Provide example input data for a specific process.

The process logic SHOULD include a delay, whether through actual processing or a simple sleep mechanism, in order to test asynchronous execution.
