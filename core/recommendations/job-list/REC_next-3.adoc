identifier:: /rec/job-list/next-3

If there are more jobs in the selection that have not yet been returned, the number of jobs in a response to dereferencing a next page link (relation: `next`) SHOULD follow the same rules as for the response to the original query and again include a next page link (relation: `next`).
