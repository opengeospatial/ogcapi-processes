== Requirements Class "Core"

The following section describes the core requirements class.

=== Overview

include::requirements/requirements_class_core.adoc[]

A server that implements the OGC API - Processes provides access to processes.

Each OGC API - Processes has a single `LandingPage` (path `/`) that provides links to

* The `APIDefinition` (no fixed path),
* The `Conformance` statements (path `/conformance`),
* The `processes` metadata (path `/processes`).

Note that additional requirements classes may introduce additional links for the landing page.

The `APIDefinition` describes the capabilities of the server that can be used by
clients to connect to the server or by development tools to support the
implementation of servers and clients. Accessing the `APIDefinition` using
HTTP GET returns a description of the API.

Accessing `Conformance` using HTTP GET returns a list of URIs of
requirements classes implemented by the server.

The list of processes contains a summary of each process the OGC API - Processes offers, including the link to a more detailed description of the process.

The process description contains information about inputs and outputs and a link to the execution-endpoint for the process. 

A HTTP POST request to the execution-endpoint creates a new job. The inputs and outputs need to be passed in a JSON execute-request.

The URL for accessing status information is delivered in the HTTP header `location`.

After a process is finished (status = success/failed), the results/exceptions can be retrieved.

[[sc_api_definition]]
=== Retrieve an API definition

The following section defines the requirements to retrieve an API definition.

==== Operation

Every OGC API - Processes provides an API definition that describes the capabilities
of the server. This definition is used by developers to understand the API,
by software clients to connect to the server, or
by development tools to support the implementation of servers and clients.

include::requirements/core/REQ_api-definition-op.adoc[]

include::recommendations/core/PER_api-definition-uri.adoc[]

Note that multiple API definition formats can be supported.

==== Response

include::requirements/core/REQ_api-definition-success.adoc[]

include::recommendations/core/REC_api-definition-oas.adoc[]

If multiple API definition formats are supported by a server, use
content negotiation to select the desired representation.

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
Two common approaches are:

* an additional path for each encoding of each resource (this can be expressed,
for example, using format specific suffixes like ".html");

* an additional query parameter (for example, "accept" or "f") that overrides
the Accept header of the HTTP request.

=====================================================================

The API definition document describes the API. In other words,
there is no need to include the `/api` operation in the API definition itself.

The idea is that any OGC API - Processes can be used by developers that are familiar with
the API definition language(s) supported by the server. For example, if
an OpenAPI definition is used, it should be possible to create a working
client using the OpenAPI definition. The developer may need to learn a little
bit about geospatial data types, etc., but it should not be required to read
this standard to access the processes and results via the API.

==== Error situations

See <<http_status_codes>> for general guidance.

[[sc_conformance_classes]]
=== Declaration of conformance classes

==== Operation

To support "generic" clients for accessing servers implementing OGC API - Processes in general - and
not "just" a specific API / server, the server has to declare the
requirements classes it implements and conforms to.

include::requirements/core/REQ_conformance-op.adoc[]

==== Response

=== Use of HTTP 1.1

include::requirements/core/REQ_http.adoc[]

[[http_status_codes]]
==== HTTP status codes

<<status_codes>> lists the main HTTP status codes that clients should be
prepared to receive.

This includes, for example, support for specific security schemes or URI
redirection.

In addition, other error situations may occur in the transport layer
outside of the server.

[#status_codes,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
.Typical HTTP status codes
[cols="15,85",options="header"]
!===
|Status code |Description
|`200` |A successful request.
|`201` |The request was successful and one or more new resources have being created.
|`204` |The request was successful but did not generate any content.
|`400` |The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error. For example, a query parameter had an incorrect value.
|`401` |The request requires user authentication. The response includes a `WWW-Authenticate` header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource.
|`403` |The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. While status code `401` indicates missing or bad authentication, status code `403` indicates that authentication is not the issue, but the client is not authorized to perform the requested operation on the resource.
|`404` |The requested resource does not exist on the server. For example, a path parameter had an incorrect value.
|`405` |The request method is not supported. For example, a POST request was submitted, but the resource only supports GET requests.
|`406` |The `Accept` header submitted in the request did not support any of the media types supported by the server for the requested resource.
|`410` |The target resource is no longer available at the origin server.
|`429` |The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting").
|`500` |An internal error occurred in the server.
|`501` |The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
!===

More specific guidance is provided for each resource, where applicable.

include::recommendations/core/PER_additional-status-codes.adoc[]

=== Support for cross-origin requests

Access to content from a HTML page is by default prohibited for security reasons if the content is located on another host than the webpage ("same-origin policy"). Cross-origin resource sharing is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served. A typical example is a web-application accessing processes and data from multiple servers.

include::recommendations/core/REC_cross-origin.adoc[]

Two common mechanisms to support cross-origin requests are:

* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing[Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)]
* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP[JSONP (JSON with padding)]

==== Response

The manner in which a server responds to a process execution request is influenced by the following parameters:

* the execution mode negotiated between the client and the server (`sync` or `async`)
* the `response` parameter (`document` or `raw`),
* the `transmissionMode` parameter (`value` or `reference`)
* and the number of output requested.

The following table maps the possible responses based on the combinations of these execute parameters.

include::recommendations/core/REC_core_job-creation-sync-document-ref.adoc[]

In the case of asynchronous execution, the following requirement applies:

include::requirements/core/REQ_job-creation-success-async.adoc[]

==== Error situations

See <<http_status_codes>> for general guidance.

If the process with the specified identifier does not exist on the server, the status code of the response SHALL be `404` (see <<req_core_no-such-process,/req/core/process-exception/no-such-process>>).

[[sc_retrieve_status_info]]
=== Retrieve status information about a job

The following section describes the requirements to retrieve information about the status of a job.

==== Operation

[source,yaml]
----
include::openapi/schemas/statusInfo.yaml[]
----

The job status information includes several optional date-time fields that represent milestones in the lifecycle of a job.   The following are recommended for servers that decide to populate some or all of these date-time fields:

include::recommendations/core/REC_job-status.adoc[]

NOTE: Once a job has finished execution and is no longer consuming compute resources, the duration of processing can be computed as `finished-started`.  The `updated` field, however, may still be revised as the system continues processing outputs, storing results, releasing compute resources, etc.

[[sc_retrieve_job_results]]
=== Retrieve job results

The following section describes the requirements to retrieve the results of a job. In case the job execution failed, an exception is returned.

==== Operation

include::requirements/core/REQ_job-result-op.adoc[]

==== Response

The manner in which a server responds when retrieving job results depends on the values of the following parameters used on the execute request that created the job:

* the execution mode as negotiated between the client and the server (`sync` or `async`)
* the `response` parameter (`document` or `raw`),
* the `transmissionMode` parameter (`value` or `reference`)
* and the number of output requested.

The following table maps the possible responses based on the combinations of these execute parameters.

This specification does not mandate that servers create a job as a result of executing a process sychronously.  However the following permission is given:

include::recommendations/core/PER_job-creation-sync-job.adoc[]

For servers that create a job as a result of synchronously execution a process, 
the following requirement applies:

include::requirements/core/REQ_job-results-success-sync.adoc[]

The referenced job can then be used to re-fetch the results of the original synchronous execution.

The following requirements apply when retrieving the results of a job that was created by executing a process synchronously OR was created by execution a process synchronously on a server that creates a job even on synchronous execution:
