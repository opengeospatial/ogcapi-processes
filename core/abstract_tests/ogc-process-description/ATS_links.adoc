1. Retrieve a description of each process according to test <<ats_core_process-description-op,/conf/core/process-description-op>>.

2. For each process, verify that the description includes a link (relation: `self`) pointing to itself.

3. If the server indicates that it supports other representations of the process description, verify that the description includes a link (relation: `alternate`) for each alternative representation of the process description.
