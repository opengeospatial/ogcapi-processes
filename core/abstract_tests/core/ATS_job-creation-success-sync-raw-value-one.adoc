|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/core/job-creation-sync-raw-value-one*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that the server responds as expected when only a single output value is requested, the process is executed synchronously, the response type is `raw` and the output transmission is `value`.
^|Test Method |. Get a description of each process offered by the server using test <<ats_core_process,/conf/core/process>>.
. Inspect the description of each process and identify the subset of processes that support the `value` output transmission and only support `sync-execute` in the job control options.
. For each identified process construct an execute request according to test <<ats_core_job-creation-request,/conf/core/job-creation-request>> ensuring that only one output is requested, the requested response type is `raw` (i.e. `"response": "raw"`) and the output transmission is set to `value` (i.e. `"transmissionMode": "value"`) according to requirement <<req_core_job-creation-sync-raw-value-one,/req/core/job-creation-sync-raw-value-one>>.
. Verify that each process executes successfully according to test <<ats_core_job-creation-sync-raw-value-one,/conf/core/job-creation-sync-raw-value-one>>.
