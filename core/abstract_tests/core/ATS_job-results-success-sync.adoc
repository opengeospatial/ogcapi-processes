|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/core/job-results-sync*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that the server responds as expected when getting results from a job for a process executed synchronously (i.e. mode is `sync`).
^|Test Method |. Get a description of each process offered by the server using test <<ats_core_process,/conf/core/process>>.
. Inspect the description of each process and identify the subset of processes that support the `sync-execute` job control option.
. For each identified process construct an execute request according to test <<ats_core_job-creation-request,/conf/core/job-creation-request>> ensuring that the execution mode is set to `sync` (i.e. `"mode": "sync"`) according to requirement <<req_core_job-creation-sync,/req/core/job-creation-sync>>.
. Inspect the headers of the response and see if a `Link` header is included with `rel=monitor`.
. If the link exists, get the job status as per test <<ats_core_job-op,/conf/core/job-op>> and ensure that the job status is set to `completed`.
. Get the results as per test <<ats_core_job-result-op,/conf/core/job-result>> and verify that they conform to the test <<ats_core_job-results-sync,/conf/core/job-results-sync>>.
