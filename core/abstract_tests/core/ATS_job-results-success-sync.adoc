1. Get a description of each process offered by the server using test <<ats_core_process-description,/conf/core/process-description>>.

2. Inspect the description of each process and identify the subset of processes that support the `sync-execute` job control option.

3. For each identified process construct an execute request according to test <<ats_core_process-execute-request,/conf/core/process-execute-request>> ensuring that synchronous execution is <<sc_execution_mode,negotiated>> according to test <<ats_core_process-execute-default-execution-mode,/conf/core/process-execute-default-execution-mode>>.

4. Inspect the headers of the response and see if a `Link` header is included with `rel=monitor`.

5. If the link exists, get the job status as per test <<ats_core_job-op,/conf/core/job-op>> and ensure that the job status is set to `successful`.
