1. Create a job as per <<ats_core_process-execute-op,/req/core/process-execute-op>> but arrange a priori that the job will fail; note the {jobID} assigned to the job.

2. Ensure that the failed job will not result in an HTTP error code of 404.

3. Issue an HTTP GET request to the URL '/jobs/{jobID}/results'.

4. Validate that the document was returned with a HTTP error code (4XX or 5XX).

5. Validate that the document contains an exception `type` that corresponds to the reason the job failed (e.g. InvalidParameterValue for invalid input data).

6. Validate the document for all supported media types using the resources and tests identified in <<job-results-failed-schema>>

NOTE: The job results page for a job may be retrieved in a number of different formats. The following table identifies the applicable schema document for each format and the test to be used to validate the job results for a failed job against that schema.  All supported formats should be exercised.
