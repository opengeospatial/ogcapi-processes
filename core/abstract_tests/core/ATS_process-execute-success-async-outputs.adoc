1. Negotiate asynchronous process execution as per test <<ats_core_process-execute-auto-execution-mode,/conf/core/process-execute-auto-execution-mode>> or <<ats_core_process-execute-default-execution-mode,/conf/core/process-execute-default-execution-mode>>.

2. Ensure that the <<execute-request-body,execute request>>, requests a subset of the defined process outputs.  Some of the defined process output should be explicitly omitted from the <<execute-request-body,execute request>>.

3. Explicitly fetch each of the requested outputs via the `/jobs/{jobID}/results/{outputID}` endpoint and verify that the server responds successfully.

4. Explicity fetch one or more of the outputs that were omitted from the <<execute-request-body,execute request>> and verify that the server responds with HTTP status code of `404`.
