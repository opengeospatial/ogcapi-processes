== Requirements Class "OGC Process Description"

The following section describes the `OGC Process Description` requirements
class.

=== Overview

include::requirements/requirements_class_ogc-process-description.adoc[]

The OGC process description is an information model that may be used to specify the interface of a process.  This model is an evolution of the process description model originally defined in the http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-065/14-065.html[OGC WPS 2.0.2 Interface Standard] but also include elements of the http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3[OpenAPI Speicification].  Specifically, this process description languges uses https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core.html[JSON Schema] fragments to define the input and output parameters of a process.  As such, this process description provides a bridge from legacy implementations to the OGC API Framework.

The process description allows the following information to be specified:

* An identifier for the process
* Descriptive metadata about the process;
** A title
** A narrative description of the process
** Keywords that can be associated with the process
** References to additional metadata
* A description of each process input specified using a https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core.html[JSON Schema] fragment.
* A description of each process output specified using a https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core.html[JSON Schema] fragment.
* A job control specification that indicates whether the process can be invoked synchronously, asynchronously, or either.
* An output transmission specification that indicates how the results of a process are retrieved; either by value or by reference
* A section for additional parameters that are intended for communities of use to extend the process description as required

The following clause defines a JSON-encoding of the OGC process description.

The schema imports the elements from the <<schema-processSummary, process summary>> and specifies an object for the definition of process inputs and another object for the definition of process outputs.

.Mixed type input example.

The following JSON Schema fragment illustrates how to define an input of mixed type.  In this case, the `imageInput` input can be one a couple of image media type encoded as either `binary` or `base64`.

The execution mode for each process is specified using the `jobControlOptions` key in the <<schema-processSummary, process summary>>.  The following requirement indicates how to specify the default execution mode.

.Retrieving a process description.

The following is an example of HTTP GET request for retrieving the list of offered processes encoded as JSON.
