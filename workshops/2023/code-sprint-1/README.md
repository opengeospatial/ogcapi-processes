# 2023 OGC API - Processes Virtual Code Sprint

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) invites developers to the *2023 OGC API – Processes Virtual Code Sprint*, which will focus on refining the next version of the OGC API - Processes standard and associated extensions. The virtual code sprint will be held from the 18th to 20th September 2023. The virtual code sprint will run from 9:00am to 5:30pm US Eastern Time each day. [Registration for the code sprint is here](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-processes/blob/master/workshops/2023/code-sprint-1/2023_09_code_sprint_registration.adoc).

An OGC Sprint is a collaborative and inclusive event driven by innovative and rapid programming with minimal process and organization constraints to support the development of new applications and candidate standards.

The OGC API – Processes Virtual Code Sprint will be open to the general public.

The [OGC API - Processes](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/processes/) Standard supports the wrapping of computational tasks into executable processes that can be offered by a server through a Web API and be invoked by a client application. Typically, these processes combine raster, vector, coverage and/or point cloud data with well-defined algorithms to produce new information. Examples of computational processes that can be supported by implementations of this Standard include vector data analysis, imagery analysis, and various types of Artificial Intelligence (AI) enhanced analysis. 

There will be an opportunity for joint discussion with all participants on the goals and objectives of the event, as well as the final briefing of findings and opinions of the participants. However, the majority of the time will be spent in collaboration between participants in active coding.
