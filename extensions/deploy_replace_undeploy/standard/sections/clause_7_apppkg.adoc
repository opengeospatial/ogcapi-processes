== Requirements Class "OGC Application Package"

[[ogcapppkg-overview]]
=== Overview

include::../requirements/requirements_class_ogcapppkg.adoc[]

This requirements class defines the schema of an `OGC Application Package`. An
`OGC Application Package` is a document that describes a process in sufficient
detail so that an implementation of this extension can dynamically deploy the
process and make it accessible via an OGC API - Processes implementation.

The information contained in an `OGC Application Package` can include:

* A formal description of the process including what inputs the process takes and what outputs the process generates.
* Either an inline or by reference execution unit which is the `code` that the server needs to execute whenever the process is invoked.
* Additional resource information required by the execution unit.
