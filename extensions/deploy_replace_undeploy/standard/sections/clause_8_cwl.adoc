=== Overview

include::../requirements/requirements_class_cwl.adoc[]

A server that implements this conformance class supports the use of CWL encoding when interacting with the deploy-replace-undeploy extension from a processes API.

In consequence, the following recommandations become requirements:

 * <<rec_deploy-replace-undeploy_deploy_body-cwl,/rec/deploy-replace-undeploy/deploy/body-cwl>>
 * <<rec_deploy-replace-undeploy_replace_body-cwl,/rec/deploy-replace-undeploy/replace/body-cwl>>
 * <<rec_ogcapppkg_execution-unit-cwl,/rec/deploy-replace-undeploy/ogcapppkg/execution-unit-cwl>>
