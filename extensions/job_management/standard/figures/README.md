Figures go here.

Each figure is a separate file with the naming convention:

"PTm_FIGn.xxx" where "m" is a number with leading zeroes appropriate for the total number of parts, "n" is a number with leading zeroes appropriate for the total number of figures and "xxx" is the appropriate extension for the file type.
