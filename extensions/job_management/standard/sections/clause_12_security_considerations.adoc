== Security Considerations

See <<OAProc-1,OGC API - Processes - Part 1: Core>>, Clause 10.4.

Since creating and updating jobs will change the jobs available to a client, servers will - in almost all cases - restrict the access to these operations.

Users making modifications to job resources need to:

. Be authenticated,
. Have "modification privileges" on the jobs offered through the API,
. Have access to one or more of the POST and/or PATCH methods on the jobs `/job` and `/jobs/{jobID}` endpoints.

The API definition, as defined in Clause 7.3 from <<OAProc-1>>, must reflect this in the resource paths and their available methods.
