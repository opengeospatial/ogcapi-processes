    WARNING - THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS\
    Sample GNOSIS Map Server OGC API test implementation.

    Project led by Ecere Corporation and supported by in-kind contributions from collaborating OGC members and research centers.

    Financial support provided by GeoConnections, a national collaborative initiative led by Natural Resources Canada.  GeoConnections supports the integration and use of the Canadian Geospatial Data Infrastructure (CGDI), an on-line resource that improves the sharing, access and use of open geospatial information.
