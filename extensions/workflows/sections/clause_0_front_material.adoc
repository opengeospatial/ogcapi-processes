.Preface

OGC API standards define modular API building blocks to spatially enable Web APIs in a consistent way. The OpenAPI specification is used to define the API building blocks.

_OGC API - Processes_ provides API building blocks to describe, execute, monitor and retrieve results of Web-accessible processes. _OGC API - Processes_ is
comprised of multiple parts, each of them is a separate standard. The conformance classes defined in this _Part 3_ document leverage conformance classes defined in _Part 1: Core_, and in some cases
conformance classes defined in _Part 2: Deploy, Replace, Undeploy_.

The development of this extension has been financially supported by GeoConnections, a national collaborative initiative led by Natural Resources Canada.
GeoConnections supports the integration and use of the Canadian Geospatial Data Infrastructure (CGDI), an on-line resource that improves the sharing,
access and use of open geospatial information.

*ISO Declaration*

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.

International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.

The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.

== Abstract

This specification extends the core capabilities specified in _OGC API - Processes - Part 1: Core_ with the ability to chain nested processes,
refer to both local and external processes and collections of data accessible via OGC API standards as inputs to a process, and trigger execution of processes
through OGC API data delivery specifications such as _OGC API - Tiles_, _DGGS_, _Coverages_, _Features_, _EDR_ and _Maps_.
Conformance classes defined in this specification enable clients to integrate discovered data and processes as a workflow in an ad-hoc manner
(without first requiring to deploy the workflow as a process), then drive the execution on-demand for a particular area, time and resolution of interest using
a "pull" mechanism (pulling the final required output from the client, as opposed to a batch execution starting from source inputs of the first processing step).
The workflows defined with this specification can also be deployed as processes using the _OGC API - Processes - Part 2: Deploy, Replace, Undeploy_ extension.
