== Overview

As an extension to https://docs.ogc.org/is/18-062r2/18-062r2.html[_OGC API - Processes - Part 1: Core_], this specification defines conformance classes for:

* extending execution requests submitted to `/processes/{processId}/execution`
   ** referencing local and remote nested processes as inputs (`"process"`) (<<section_nested_processes,Section 7>>),
   ** referencing local and remote OGC API collections as inputs (`"collection"`) (<<section_collection_input,Section 8>>),
   ** modifying data accessed as inputs and returned as outputs (filtering with `"filter"`, selecting and deriving fields with `"properties"`, sorting with `"sortby"`) (<<section_fields_modifiers,Section 9>>),
   ** deploying workflows defined using such execution request as processes using https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-processes/tree/master/extensions/deploy_replace_undeploy/standard[_OGC API - Processes - Part 2: Deploy, Replace, Undeploy_], with the ability to paremeterize inputs (`"$input"`) and select outputs (`"$output"`) (<<section_deployable_workflows,Section 10>>),
* requesting output data from OGC API data collections to trigger processing execution (<<section_collection_output,Section 11>>),
* ad-hoc execution of workflows defined using the Common Workflow Language (<<section_cwl_workflows,Section 12>>), and
* ad-hoc execution of workflows defined using the OpenEO Process Graphs (<<section_openeo_workflows,Section 13>>).

The following diagram illustrates how the conformance classes defined in this specification
extending _OGC API - Processes - Part 1: Core_ execution request as well as describing a new
"Collection Output" execution mechanism work together with OGC API data access specifications.

=== Design goals

==== Objective

This specification aims to enable instant integration of geospatial data and processing capabilities available from anywhere for visualization and analysis.

==== Obstacles addressed

===== Long batch processing times

The conformance classes defined in this specification aim to avoid long batch processing times, because they present several drawbacks:

* long feedback loops (configuring and adjusting parameters, retrieving and preparing input data, processing, visualizing / validating output for entire large datasets) slow down research and products deployment,
* processing results may be outdated by the time they are ready,
* batch processing entire datasets makes it difficult to prioritize more important processing (e.g., higher priority clients, emergency response) over less important requests
  (e.g., flooding attacks, high volume of requests from low priority clients),
* inefficient use of storage, bandwidth, computing, time, and therefore financial resources (large portions of datasets may be processed without the results ever getting used).

===== Integration of diverse data and processes

The conformance classes defined in this specification aim to address the following challenges bringing together datasets and processes from different origins:

* the suitability and compatility of data sources and processing capabilities,
* the added complexity of deploying processes or workflow definitions in order to execute them, and associated authentication requirements,
* the interoperability issues associated with specific expectations in terms of format or API as part of a workflow definition,
* the possibility of re-using a workflow definition with similar datasets, and multiple areas, times or regions of interest.

==== Framework

These challenges are addressed within the consistent framework of the OGC API family of standards, as defined by _OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core_ and _Part 2: Geospatial data_,
by extending the processing capabilities defined in _OGC API - Processes - Part 1: Core_ and _Part 2: Deploy, Replace, Undeploy_ with the ability to seamlessly and effortlessly
integrate with the access capabilities defined in OGC API data access specifications (such as _OGC API - Tiles, DGGS, Coverages, Features, EDR, Maps_...).

==== Approach

The conformance classes defined in this specification allow to:

* _**easily connect data and processes from anywhere in a re-usable and interoperable manner by**_
   ** leveraging the consistency of the OGC API family of standards, making it easy to find relevant processes and data collections regardless of access mechanisms,
   ** leveraging the concept of a https://github.com/opengeospatial/styles-and-symbology/issues/12[_GeoDataClass_], to easily establish the compatibility of a given data as an input to a particular process,
   ** allowing ad-hoc execution of workflows definitions, without first needing to deploy the workflow as a process, making it more accessible for integration,
   ** select formats and access mechanisms outside workflow definition, negotiating at each hop of a workflow, therefore making them more interoperable and re-usable,
   ** making workflows definitions agnostic of area, time and region of interest, therefore easier to re-use;

* _**trigger on-demand processing with OGC API data access requests by**_
   ** allowing regular OGC API data access clients to readily support processing while requiring very minimal processing-specific code (performing a single POST request),
   ** prioritizing client requests, which means always accessing the latest available data,
   ** enabling instant feedback allowing to validate and tweak input parameters based on initial small requests tailored to the area and resolution of interest of a given view (or preview) of the results;

* _**minimize data exchange bandwidth requirements by**_
   ** requesting subset and downsampled data focusing on area, time, resolution and fields/bands of interests,
   ** allowing to optimize usage of processing and bandwidth resources while decreasing wait times.

==== Considerations for collection input / output

An important design goal of this extension is to separate from the workflow definition the negotiation of formats,
data transfer APIs, area, time and resolution of intererest, and selection of outputs, therefore greatly enhancing the re-usability of the workflows.
This negotiation happens at each hop along a workflow chain, and the end-user client need only decide on these for the server it directly connnects to (immediate hop).
For example, some hops may operate better using DGGS zone IDs, while other using subset requests, and yet others using tiles; or some hops may support and work best with some format or API,
while others work best with another.

When setting up a new workflow for collection output our asynchronous execution, if possible, the API should fully validate the immediate process and all nested inputs prior to returning a result.
A successful result indicates a fully validated workflow which should normally succeed for requests within the range for which data is produced.
It is expected that clients may make a large number of requests for the same workflow e.g., using subset or tiles or DGGS zone ID to trigger processing of a specific Area of Interest or resolution,
as a client pans and zooms around a map.

With _collection input / output_, formats, CRS, specific APIs, or specific APIs do not have to be specified and should not be, so as to maximize the re-usability of the workflow.
e.g., the data requests triggering the processing would specify the output formats via content type negotiation, and tiles requests would provide the AoI and resolution for any specific request which
would propagate upwards in the workflow request chain.
