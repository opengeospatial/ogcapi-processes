== OpenEO Process Graphs Workflow Conformance Class

=== Requirement Class _OpenEO Process Graphs Workflow_

The _OpenEO Process Graphs Workflow_ conformance class specifies the use of
https://openeo.org/documentation/1.0/developers/api/reference.html#section/Processes/Process-Graphs[OpenEO Process Graphs] to define workflows as an alternative to an extended
_OGC API - Processes - Part 1: Core_ execution request, to be executed in an ad-hoc manner
(a workflow that is not first required to be deployed as a process before being executed).

The capability to deploy an OpenEO workflow definition as a process using _OGC API - Processes - Part 2: Deploy, Replace, Undeploy_
is already covered by a conformance class of Part 2.

*TODO*: Verify that an OpenEO conformance class already exists or is planned for _Part 2_.

*TODO*: Verify and describe which (if any) of the other conformance classes defined in this extension applies to ad-hoc OpenEO workflows.

The following requirements describe the ability of an implementation to execute an openEO process graph workflow in an ad-hoc manner and return its output, without requiring a prior deployment.
