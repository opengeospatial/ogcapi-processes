== Deployable Workflows Conformance Class

=== Requirement Class _Deployable Workflows_

The _Deployable Workflows_ conformance class specifies how a workflow execution request as defined in
_OGC API - Processes - Part 1: Core_, with or without the capabilities defined in other conformance classes
of this _Part 3_ extension, can be used as an application package payload to deploy new processes using
_OGC API - Processes - Part 2: Deploy, Replace, Undeploy_.

It also specifies how to parameterize inputs to the workflow as inputs to the deployed process,
and how to select specific outputs from the processes involved to be returned as outputs of the deployed process.

include::../requirements/requirements_class_deployable-workflows.adoc[]

The following requirements describe the ability of an implementation to deploy a new process
defined as an _OGC API - Processes - Part 1: Core_ execution request with
_OGC API - Processes - Part 2: Deploy, Replace, Undeploy_,
including parameterizing inputs as external inputs to the deployed process using `{ "$input" : "{inputID}" }` as input objects (in `"inputs"`),
and selecting specific outputs to be returned from the deployed process using `{ "$output" : "{outputID}" } as output objects  (in `"outputs"`).
If no `"$output"` object is used within a deployed workflow definition, the deployed process is
assumed to return all outputs from the top-level process with the same names as that process.

A minimal but adequate process description for the resulting process can automatically be generated
based on the context where the `"$input"` and `"$output"` objects appear within the workflow definition, allowing
to describe all inputs to the process and its outputs by inferrence from the source process descriptions
and/or input data.

The workflow definition could either directly be the payload of the `POST` request to `/processes` (using `Content-Type: application/json`),
or be part of the `executionUnit` of an OGC Application Package as defined in Part 2's _OGC Application Package_
conformance class (using `Content-Type: application/ogcapppkg+json`).

NOTE: The `application/ogcapppkg+json` media type needs to be registered with IANA.
