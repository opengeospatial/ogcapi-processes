description:: For referencing a remote process as an input to another process:
part:: The Implementation SHALL support execution requests containing a `"process"` key and a corresponding URI or Relative-URI value identifying an authorized remote process as an input to another process.
====

NOTE: The specification is agnostic to how an implementation determines whether a remote process is authorized or not. This may be based e.g., on allow/disallow lists, credentials and/or federations.
