identifier:: /req/deployable-workflows/parameterized-outputs
description:: For deploying workflow definitions defined as an execution request:
part:: The Implementation SHALL support selecting specific outputs of processess involved in workflow definition using the `"$output"` key and a corresponding output identifier value as part of an output of a process (within the `outputs` of an execution request or nested input process).
part:: The deployed process SHALL have a corresponding output for each output selected using the `"$output"` using the specified name.
part:: Each output of the deployed process SHALL inherit the expected data type of the output in the context where the `"$output"` key is specified.
part:: If no "$output" key appears in a workflow definition, the Implementation SHALL assume that all outputs from the top-level process are returned, using the same name as specified in the description of that top-level process.
