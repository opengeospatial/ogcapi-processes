description:: For executing workflow definitions referencing a collection as an input to a process:
part:: The Implementation SHALL support accessing local collections (as defined by _OGC API - Common - Part 2: Geospatial data_) accessible using at least one OGC API data access mechanisms (e.g., _OGC API - Tiles, Coverages, DGGS, Features, EDR, Maps_) as an input to a process.

NOTE: For local collections, the specification is agnostic to how data flows from the collection to the process.
