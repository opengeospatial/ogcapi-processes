label:: /req/nested-processes/process-execution
description:: For executing workflow definitions referencing a nested process:
part:: The Implementation SHALL support executing local processes which can be executed using _OGC API - Process - Part 1: Core_ as a process nested as an input to another process.
part:: The Implementation SHALL consider the selected output (using the "outputs" key), or default to the only or first output of the process as the input.

NOTE: For local processes, the specification is agnostic to how data flows from one process to the other.
