description:: For executing workflow definitions referencing a collection as an input to a process:
part:: The Implementation SHALL support accessing a remote OGC API collection using one or more OGC API data access mechanisms (e.g., _OGC API - Tiles, Coverages, DGGS, Features, EDR, Maps_...) as an input to a process.
====

TODO: Separate conformance classes may need to be defined for each specification to clarify for which processing services can act as a client to supporting collection access to avoid clients defining invalid workflows.
